	"bio": "Drawing as far as i can remember, I let the passion go away something like ten years now, even if time to time, lines came out of my work . I discovered the world of papertoys in 2011 and since that day, i started collecting and building papertoys as a sick boy, then customised some to finally create my first one few years later.\nStill in the game even if quite quiet these times.",
