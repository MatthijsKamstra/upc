	"bio": "Grutte Pier was an infamous Frisian rebel leader and pirate, born in 1480. He challenged the established of the era and tried to reclaim justice for the people with fierce dedication. Matthijs is our very own Grutte Pier. He is big, yes he is. But his Pier-ness shows especially in his brave and chronic playful attitude towards working and making. He hacked our very own bot that helps us prepare lunch and has a fully automatic alter ego on Twitter that is always sharing awkward and funny thoughts with his fans. Matthijs uses code as a paintbrush, as an artistic tool to achieve creative goals. This â€“ next to his superhero size - makes him a fine partner to work with. Crazy is good, laughing is important, and tech is a human tool.",
