	"bio": "Iâ€™m a paper toys lover, a graphic designer at a small firm in the city of Bandung, Indonesia. Doing paper toys is a really fun hobby for me, where I can share free templates on the internet, so people around the world can assemble and feel the pleasure of paper toys, and of course, I got so many new friends with paper toys. Many kinds paper toys that I have created, ranging from monsters to robots, from traditional themes to hip-hop themes. I also joined several exhibitions, workshops, doing collaboration works with designers all around the world and contributing on several international books..",
