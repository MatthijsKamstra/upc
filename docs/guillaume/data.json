	"bio": "Hello, I’m Guillaume but you can call me Tougui! I’m a freelance graphic designer established near Annecy in France. As far as I can remember, I have always loved drawing, and I directed my studies towards that objective. After I graduated from the Ecole des Gobelins of Paris in 2007, I started my freelance career. Mostly inspired by street art and snow sports, I progressively enriched my graphic style to create my very own universe. I quickly succeeded in distinguishing myself from the scenery, which allows me now to work along with brands in co-branding operations. I’m passionate and curious, always looking for new mediums to discover. In 2005, I discovered the PAPERTOY and my work got a whole new dimension : I am now able to develop my products entirely from conception to production, and through the magic that is the internet, distribute them all around the world. Today, I split my time between commercial and personal projects.",
